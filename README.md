## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I realized that when I use a transition for the appearance of the image view, it changes size when I remove the mouse, and I haven't found a solution for this yet.
